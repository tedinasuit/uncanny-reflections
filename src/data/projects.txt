    fullDescription: "Next Nature Museum, inside the UFO-shaped Evoluon in Eindhoven, explores how technology becomes our ‘next nature’. For International Week, a 4-day challenge, I led an international team to design and prototype ‘NextBots’: small, friendly, plant-adorned robot guides presented as a hologram on a Looking Glass Portrait. We built a WebXR (Three.js) experience, bridged an Arduino proximity sensor via Node.js, and staged a mini-exhibition. The project won the WOW Group award.",
