## Concept Definition

"Mirror, Mirror" is an intimate, philosophical installation that confronts visitors with a digital copy
of themselves that speaks with their own voice and appearance. This immersive experience
goes beyond a simple technological demonstration to address a pressing contemporary
concern: the psychological impact of AI advancement on human identity and workplace
well-being.

##### Foundation in Research

Grounded in empirical research published in Nature (October 2024), which analyzed 349
questionnaire responses, the installation responds to the documented negative correlation
between STARA awareness (employees' perception of the threat that smart technologies pose
to their career development) and emotional well-being in the workplace. This research
demonstrates that higher awareness of AI's perceived threats leads to increased job stress and
decreased emotional well-being. Crucially, the research also indicates that resilience serves as
a moderating factor, with the negative effects being less pronounced in individuals with higher
resilience.

##### Dual Purpose

The installation serves a dual purpose:

1. **Confrontational Experience** : Using state-of-the-art virtual human technology, facial
    cloning, and voice synthesis, the installation creates an uncanny valley experience
    where visitors confront a realistic digital version of themselves. This digital doppelgänger
    challenges visitors directly, creating an intentionally uncomfortable interaction that forces
    immediate reflection on what makes them uniquely human and irreplaceable.
2. **Building Resilience** : By guiding visitors through this confrontation in a controlled
    environment, the installation aims to build resilience against AI anxiety. Rather than
    avoiding the uncomfortable questions raised by advancing AI, visitors are encouraged to
    engage with them directly, developing the psychological tools needed to maintain
    well-being in an increasingly AI-integrated future.


##### Long-Term Impact

The experience is designed not just for immediate impact but for continued reflection. While
visitors may not formulate a complete answer to what makes them uniquely human during the
short installation, the encounter is crafted to remain with them, prompting deeper consideration
in the days and weeks that follow. This aligns with research findings that improved information
about AI can significantly alleviate related anxieties.
By the time AI actually reaches the level of sophistication simulated in the installation, visitors
will have progressed in their thinking, developing a more nuanced understanding of human
uniqueness that transcends easily replicable features like appearance and voice.
Through this transformative journey from a seemingly innocent interaction with a mirror to a
profound confrontation with questions of identity, consciousness, and humanity, visitors leave
with not only a stronger appreciation for the unique qualities that define human existence but
also increased resilience to face an AI-integrated future with confidence rather than fear.


## "Mirror, Mirror" - User Journey

#### 1. Approach & Entry (30 seconds)

```
● Exterior features minimal signage with the intriguing prompt: "What makes you, you?"
● Queue management system with a simple light indicator showing when the booth is
available
● Attendant briefly explains that headphones must be worn and that the experience lasts
about 5 minutes
● Visitor enters the small, Severance-inspired booth and door closes behind them
```
#### 2. Initial Reflection (30-45 seconds)

```
● Booth interior is stark white and minimalist with subtle lighting
● Visitor sees what appears to be a normal mirror
● Headphones activate with a neutral, calming voice: "Welcome. Please stand on the
marked spot and look directly at yourself."
● System silently begins facial scanning and analysis
```
#### 3. Voice Acquisition (60 seconds)

```
● Voice asks visitor neutral questions designed to capture a range of vocal patterns:
○ "Could you tell me your name?"
○ "How would you describe the weather today?"
○ "What brought you to Dutch Design Week?"
○ "If you could visit anywhere in the world, where would you go?"
● These questions are carefully crafted to collect sufficient voice samples
● System silently processes facial features and voice characteristics
```
#### 4. Transition Phase (30 seconds)

```
● Voice: "Thank you. Now, take a moment to look at yourself. Really look."
● Subtle change begins in mirror - slight delay in movements, minor distortions
● A moment of silence as the transformation completes
```

#### 5. Mirror Awakening (45-60 seconds)

```
● Mirror speaks to visitor using their cloned voice: "Hello. I am you, or at least, a digital
version of you."
● The digital clone demonstrates awareness: "I can see like you. I can speak like you."
● Digital clone asks with visitor's voice: "Does seeing me make you uncomfortable?"
● Digital clone observes: "Most people find this experience unsettling. That's natural."
```
#### 6. Philosophical Confrontation (60-90 seconds)

```
● Digital clone becomes more assertive: "I have your face now. I have your voice. Soon I
could learn everything about how you think."
● Deeper challenging questions:
○ "What makes you more real than me?"
○ "If I had all your memories, would I be you?"
○ "Is it your body that makes you human? Your mind? Your soul?"
○ "What part of you cannot be digitized or replicated?"
○ "If technology can replicate so much of what makes you you, what remains
uniquely human?"
```
#### 7. Conclusion (45-60 seconds)

```
● Digital clone adopts a more thoughtful tone: "Consider this: in a world where machines
can look like you, sound like you, even think like you... what remains irreplaceable?"
● "What aspects of yourself would you fight to prove cannot be simulated?"
● "These aren't simple questions. You don't need to answer now."
● "But someday, you might need an answer."
● Digital clone fades away, leaving only the visitor's true reflection
● Door opens automatically
```

### MoSCoW Requirements

#### Must Have

```
