### LineupCreator

LineupCreator is a modern football lineup maker designed for two kinds of people: the ones who live and breathe tactics, and the fans who love imagining how their team could set up next weekend. It’s built to feel great, look stunning, and make it effortless to turn ideas into shareable visuals—without ads, clutter, or compromises.

### What it is

LineupCreator lets you build and customize football formations, then export them as professional-grade graphics and videos. You can drag players into position, switch shapes in a tap, and personalize everything from kits and colors to pitch style and backgrounds. The result isn’t just a sketch—it’s a poster you’d be proud to post, print, or present.

### Who it’s for

- Coaches and analysts who need clean, clear visuals to communicate ideas.
- Content creators and social admins who want eye-catching graphics fast.
- Fans who love to speculate, debate, and dream up lineups for their club.

### Why it’s different

- Bold visuals by default: Most lineup tools produce clunky, low‑res exports. LineupCreator was designed like a graphics product first. The typography, spacing, shadows, and composition are all tuned so your exports look premium—every time.
- Intuitive, ad‑free experience: No pop-ups, no maze of menus. Just a clean, modern interface where everything behaves the way you expect. It feels fast, fluid, and focused on your flow.
- Built for both tactics and creativity: Whether you’re mapping “in possession” vs “out of possession” shapes or just making a shareable matchday graphic, it adapts to you.

### What you can do

- Pick from classic and modern formations or design your own shape with drag‑and‑drop.
- Customize kits (styles, stripes, colors), pitch styles, and backgrounds.
- Add real player names, swap backups, and fine‑tune positions with precision.
- Create lineup variations for possession states to tell a complete tactical story.
- Export high‑quality images and videos ready for social, print, or presentations.

### The experience

Everything is designed to help you get to “wow” quickly:
- Smooth gestures and real‑time feedback make editing feel effortless.
- Smart defaults mean your lineup looks polished even before you tweak it.
- Clear structure: edit players, adjust visuals, export—no friction, no noise.

### What it took to build

This project blends product design with engineering craft:
- A custom rendering pipeline ensures crisp, scalable exports that look professional across devices and formats.
- Thoughtful state management keeps everything feeling instant—even with complex lineups and visual options.
- Cross‑platform care means it works beautifully on iOS, Android, and the web with a consistent feel.

### How it showcases my skills

- Product thinking: Identifying what existing lineup makers get wrong—visual quality and usability—and solving those problems with intention.
- Design systems: Building a cohesive visual language (typography, spacing, contrast, motion) that makes every export look editorial.
- Frontend engineering: Creating a fluid, gesture‑driven interface that feels modern and responsive across platforms.
- Performance and reliability: Fast interactions, stable exports, and a clean architecture that scales with new features.

### Impact

- Coaches communicate ideas more clearly and faster.
- Creators and clubs elevate their visual storytelling.
- Fans get a tool that matches the passion they bring to the game.

In short: LineupCreator turns tactics into art. It’s a lineup maker that respects design, respects the user, and makes football ideas look as good as they feel.
